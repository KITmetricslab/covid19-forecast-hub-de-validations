main.py:
- match regex to file format (additional countries and forecast file suffixes)
- German/polish hub does not enforce metadata rules, therefore I did not add these checks. You can find the files here: https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub-validations. 
	Adding these checks should be straight forward (use US Hubs main.py as reference)
- I added a comment for .csv files that do not match the expected regex (These are likely files that break a naming convention)

test_formatting.py:
- did not incorporate validate_forecast_values.py! (compares forecast numbers with population)

covid19.py:
- Added some QoL improvements to the validate_quantile_csv function (FAddition/Deletion of allowed FIPS CODES and TARGETS is a lot easier)
- change allowed fips_codes
- change allowed file suffixes 
- If you have made significant changes to either this file, cdc_io.py or quantile_io.py you should be able to just use your changed files with minor adaptations.

forecast_date.py 
- adapt time zone
