# covid19-forecast-hub-de-validations

This repository is heavily inspired by the US covid-19 forecast hub validation repository, which can be found here: https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub-validations.
It handles the validation checks for contributions to the German and Polish covid-19 forecast hub.
